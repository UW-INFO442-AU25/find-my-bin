<br>
Ray is a first-year student living on campus at the University of Washington. He eats most of his meals through the UW dining plan.

### Goals
- Build confidence in making correct disposal choices. 
- Learn how to sort common items quickly. 

### Frustrations
- Unsure whether certain items like containers with small amounts of liquid or leftover contents can be reycled or should be thrown away instead. "Does the type of liquid matter?" "Does the amount matter?"
- Often second-guesses himself and briefly worries that he might have sorted something incorrectly. 
- Some items are just confusing — for example, a compostable paper bowl with a plastic-looking lid.

Maya is an undergraduate student at the University of Washington who commutes to campus each day. Because she has to plan around traffic, parking, and overall travel time, she is often in a rush when grabbing meals between classes. 


### Goals
- Save time during transitions between classes and meals.
- Wants to make environmentally responsible choices when possible.
- Learn what determines which bin an item belongs in.

### Frustrations
- Not all waste-sorting stations and bins show clear, uncluttered examples of disposable items.
- Worries about accidentally putting items in the wrong bin.
- Often doesn't have enough time to double-check sorting rules and be fully certain about her decision.
